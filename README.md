# GithubNotes

## Get Started
Git is the most popular version control system that developers use to track and share code. Lets learn how to collaborate on projects effectively using Git and GitHub.

- what is the source control repository and what it does do for you?
 The first things it does is it deals with these sort of situations where you have two different people working on the same file, and you both check in that same file, it will try to merge that file for you
 
 The second and more important thing is that it works as a time capsule. so over time as you make changes to files and you check them into your source control, it keeps a time log so that you've got complete history of all the files that have changed and even why they changed.

 You can see these are all the different version in version control.
 
 ### Repository Locations:
 version control system used a centralized repository
 
 - Central Repository: means is that you have multiple people and when they make changes and they make commits and store that history, it's all going to central repository, one server
 
 - Distriubted Repository: This means everbody has a complete copy of the repo. The nice thing about this is that you can make commits really quickly, can work on it offline and everybody has a complete copy. Tha way if one gets destroyed, everybody has a copy of the repo.
 
 Unlike working with a centralized repository, if you lose all your backups and your server goes down, you are out of luck.
